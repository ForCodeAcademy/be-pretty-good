                  So after courageously deciding that I wouldn't be sacrificing anything or being the best at anything, it was left to figure out what I wanted to be pretty good at.

                <div className="my-8">
                  <p className="mb-4">These needed to be categorised and after a bit of deliberation I came to:</p>

                    {categoryData.map((category, index) => (

                        <p className="font-semibold text-gray-800">{category.title}</p>

                    ))}
                  </div>
                </div>

                <p>
                  Now these can be broken down further, wider, deeper, whichever way. But these categories worked for me when looking at the bigger picture of what I wanted in my life.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg font-medium text-sage-700">
                  I wanted to be in pretty good shape, comfortable with money, happily married and overall, just happy.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Truth be told, my initial set didn't have mental health in it as I had assumed doing the other 3 would do it. But going through there were some gaps and so thought it couldn't hurt to add.
                </p>

                <div className="bg-sage-50 border-l-4 border-sage-400 p-6 my-8 rounded-r-lg">

                    If you are applying this to yourself, I would implore you to think of the areas of your life that, if deficient, would make success in other areas redundant in terms of your overall happiness.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                  These all needed to be broken down further and so these are the categories I came up with, conscious that going too far would defeat the purpose of the exercise of having time to be pretty good at most things.
